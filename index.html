        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>When I became interested in web design, I realized that I needed to learn HTML and CSS, which are the basic foundations of this field. Although it may seem easy for everyone, being creative with these two basics is actually harder than anything else. I would like to thank Dr. Angela Yu<a class="udemy" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">(Udemy)</a>training series, which helped me during this process. As I write this, I am currently starting to learn Bootstrap."</p>

      <h3>About me.</h3>
      <p>I was born on November 24, 1995, in Bahçelievler, Istanbul. I received my primary and secondary education at Yeşilyuva Primary School, where I resided in Küçükçekmece, Istanbul. After graduating from middle school, my family sent me to Saide Zorlu Trade Vocational High School in Avcılar to study Accounting, as I was not a very successful student. After high school, I completed a 2-year program in International Trade at Arel University through vertical transfer. During this time, I did an accounting internship at Defacto for 1 year and worked for 3 months. As accounting was not my area of interest, I chose International Affairs as my major through distance education during this time. While completing my 4-year program at AÖF, I also worked for about 3.5 years at Zara call center project, which is an Inditex project. After completing my military service, I started working as a Procurement and Planning Support staff at Lescon. Unfortunately, due to life circumstances, I didn't have many career choices or perhaps I could say I took refuge in that. As I grew older, I realized that some responsibilities were increasing, so I needed to take a step forward in my career. Since I had been interested in computers since childhood, I wanted to try the software industry. I liked it. This website I created is the first website where I used HTML and CSS. Also, as my English is not very good, I received some support from ChatGPT while writing this text. Thank you very much for reading this far. In the future, I will develop myself even more and upload it to Github.</p>
